Solution for the Python people here. ..as support is a bit vague to non-existent :smileymad:
 
Nidaq  with USB 6008
Reading more that 1 channel with the NIDAQ library in Python was a problem as the docs are really bad. Anyway I found a solution to do muli channel reads
My example  is with 3 channels so it could be easily adapted for more. 
 
I kept the max_num_samples deliberately small to see what was happening :-) so scale up
 
Enjoy  :smileyhappy:
